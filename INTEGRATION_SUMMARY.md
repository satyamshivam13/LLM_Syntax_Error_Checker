## 🚀 New Features Available

### Auto-Fix Feature
- **Detects and fixes:**
  - Missing colons (Python: `def`, `if`, `for`, `while`, `class`)
  - Missing semicolons (Java/C/C++: variable declarations, statements)
  - Unclosed quotes (single and double)
  - Unmatched brackets (parentheses, square, curly)
  - Indentation errors (Python)

- **Smart detection:**
  - Language-aware (applies correct fix for each language)
  - Line-by-line scanning when line number not available
  - Skips control structures and comments
  - Shows before/after code comparison

### Code Quality Analysis
- **Metrics calculated:**
  - Quality Score (0-100)
  - Total lines / Code lines / Comment lines / Blank lines
  - Code complexity (cyclomatic)
  - Comment ratio (%)
  - Average line length
  - Long function detection

- **Suggestions provided:**
  - High complexity warnings (>10)
  - Low comment ratio alerts (<10%)
  - Long line warnings (>100 chars)
  - Naming convention violations
  - Function length issues (>50 lines)

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Test Case 1: Missing Semicolon (Java)
```java
// test_semicolon.java
public class Test {
    int x = 10  // Missing semicolon
}
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Detected: `MissingDelimiter`
- ✅ Auto-fix: Added semicolon at line 3
- ✅ Quality: 60/100 with 2 suggestions

### Test Case 2: Code Quality (Python)
```python
# test_error.py
def calculate(a, b)
    return a + b
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Quality Score: 60/100
- ✅ Complexity: 79
- ✅ Suggestions: Add comments, reduce complexity

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Model Compatibility Fix
**Issue:** Models trained with scikit-learn 1.7.2, environment had 1.1.3  
**Solution:** Upgraded to scikit-learn 1.7.2  
**Impact:** Eliminated pickle compatibility errors

### Enhanced Feature Pipeline
The ML engine now extracts 10 numerical features:
1. Code length (characters)
2. Line count
3. Division operators (`/`, `%`)
4. Type conversions (`int()`, `static_cast`)
5. Missing colon detection
6. Missing semicolon detection
7. Zero comparisons (`== 0`, etc.)
8. String operations (quotes)
9. Type declarations (`int`, `float`, etc.)
10. Bracket balance score

### Architecture Pattern
```
User Input → Error Detection → Auto-Fix → Quality Analysis → Output
                  ↓                ↓              ↓
            ML Engine        AutoFixer    QualityAnalyzer
            (99.80%)        (language-    (metrics +
                            aware)         suggestions)
```
